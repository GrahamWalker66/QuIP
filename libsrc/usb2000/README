Software module for the Ocean Optics USB2000 spectometer.  Note that
(unlike when this code was developed), Ocean Optics now offers linux
support in their software, although it has not been purchased yet...

This version was developed to run over a serial port using the adaptor.
(What would be required to interface over the USB subsystem??)

The two .lmp files are the calibration data for the tungsten lamp
LS-1-CAL, s/n LSC677.  The .SMA file was collected with a "bare
SMA-terminated optical fiber," while the .CC3 date were collected
with a "cosine corrected irradiance probe."
