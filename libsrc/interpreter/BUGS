the interpret builtin command should insert the text at the current level instead of pushing.
That would allow us to push a foreach command without pushing the entire loop.

Command completion was redone (9/2016) in order to accommodate very large numbers of items
(e.g., 360,000 in the CIFP database).  Red-black trees were introduced to help with this,
but the current implementation does not correctly handle situations where the set of items
is dynamically changing...
