What is the new_stepit.c?  Was that created with the idea that the
routine would be structured and made intelligible?

What packages are needed to install sparselm?

Sparselm itself is compiled from source...
http://users.ics.forth.gr/~lourakis/sparseLM/
using version 1.3

Needs SuiteSparse:
http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/SuiteSparse (bad URL from sparseLM)
http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html
using version 4.4.4

SuiteSparse depends on -llapack and -lopenblas...

For Ubuntu:
% apt-get install liblapack-dev
% apt-get install libopenblas-dev
(libopenblas libraries installed in /usr/lib/openblas-base, which wasn't found,
so I made hard links to /usr/lib...)

cholmod requires METIS?
http://www.cs.umn.edu/~metis

% apt-get install suitesparse-metis-dev
% apt-get install libf2c2-dev
