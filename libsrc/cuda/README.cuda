Notes on cuda installation.

There are 4 .run packages to be installed in cuda4:

cudatoolkit_4.0.17_linux_64_rhel5.5.run
cudatools_4.0.17_linux_64.run
devdriver_4.0_linux_64_270.41.19.run
gpucomputingsdk_4.0.17_linux.run

The first three should be done as root (using sudo),
while the last one will be installed in the user's
directory and so does not need root privileges.
