/****************************************************************************
 *   Set Pacer Clock Frequency
 * 
 *   Description: 
 *       Set the counters so that the pacer clock runs at the
 *       desired frequency.  The frequency is generated by dividing
 *       down a 10 MHz clock, so all frequencies can not be generated.
 *       This routine calculated the divisor to generate a frequency
 *       as near as possible to the requested one.  It then calculates
 *       the real frequency and returns it .
 *
 * JBM modifications:  this is now a user-space function, we compute the dividers
 * and return them using the pointer args.
 *
